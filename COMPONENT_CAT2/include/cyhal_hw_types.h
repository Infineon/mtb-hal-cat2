/**
* \addtogroup group_hal_impl CAT2 (PMG/PSoC 4) Implementation Specific
* \{
* This section provides details about the PMG/PSoC 4 implementation of the Cypress HAL.
* All information within this section is platform specific and is provided for reference.
* Portable application code should depend only on the APIs and types which are documented
* in the @ref group_hal section.
*
* \section group_hal_impl_mapping HAL Resource Hardware Mapping
* The following table shows a mapping of each HAL driver to the lower level firmware driver
* and the corresponding hardware resource. This is intended to help understand how the HAL
* is implemented for PMG/PSoC 4 and what features the underlying hardware supports.
*

* \section group_hal_impl_errors Device Specific Errors
* Error codes generated by the low level level PDL driver all use module IDs starting

* driver in the
